# Learning Embedded Software Engineering 101 (ESE101)

## Overview

Welcome to my journey of learning [Embedded Software Engineering 101 (ESE101)](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101) ! This series is designed to equip you with the fundamental knowledge and skills required for embedded software engineering.

## Description

Embedded Software Engineering 101 (ESE101) is an educational series that provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of embedded software engineering. Throughout this series, I will delve into the core concepts, best practices, and real-world applications of embedded systems development.

## Goals

- **Understanding Concepts**: I aim to gain a solid understanding of the foundational concepts underlying embedded software engineering, including microcontrollers, firmware development, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and low-level hardware interactions.
  
- **Hands-On Experience**: Through practical coding examples and projects, I aspire to develop hands-on experience in writing efficient and reliable embedded software solutions.
  
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: By tackling various challenges and assignments, I seek to enhance my problem-solving skills and learn how to address common issues encountered in embedded software development.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find my progress and notes organized as follows:

- **Notes/**: This directory contains my detailed notes on each section or lecture of the course. These notes include key concepts, code snippets, and personal insights.

- **Code/**: This directory holds the code examples and exercises provided in the course. I'll also include my own implementations and modifications as I progress.
  
- **Resources/**: Any additional resources such as datasheets, reference manuals, or supplementary materials related to the course will be stored here.
