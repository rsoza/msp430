MSP430F5529 - memory

Memory map
	> shows adresses 
	> Flash memory 128 KB of FM
		- instructions are stored here
		- this is big enough for a fitbit or consumer toy
		- interrupt is here from 00FFFFh - 00FF80h
			Three confusing stuff about interrupt:
				1. HEX
					- Memory addresses are almost always written as hex
					- Manipulating addresses uses powers of two
					- Microprocessor uses binary so powers of two is beneficial
				2. Leading 0's
					- Leadings zero's can be removed and the hex value stays the same
					- This shows the full width of a number
					- MSP43 uses 20-bit address which means largest number = FFFFFh
					- Tells the compiler that this is a number not a variable name
				3. Direction
					- numbers are set high to low

		- in msp430 32KB (0x8000 bytes)
	> sectors: sections in RAM 
		- each 2kb (0x800 bytes)
